Introduction

Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy, and facilitating direct communication between farmers and consumers can significantly enhance the agricultural market. The project, titled “E-Agriculture for Direct Marketing of Food Crops Using Chatbot (DMCF Chatbot),” is a web-based platform aimed at revolutionizing the way agricultural products are marketed. This system bridges the gap between sellers (farmers) and bidders (buyers) by creating a transparent, efficient, and automated bidding process. Built using PHP for the front end and MySQL for the back end, the platform ensures a user-friendly interface and reliable data management for seamless operations.

The platform allows sellers to showcase their agricultural products for auction, providing essential details such as auction duration, bidding status, and current offers. Buyers can browse ongoing auctions, place bids, and track their participation in real time. The system also incorporates automated email notifications to keep users informed about crucial updates, including new bids, auction closures, and transaction statuses. By integrating a chatbot with 70-80% query accuracy, the platform ensures that vendors can easily find preferred auctions, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

In addition to facilitating transactions, the system includes features like user reviews, moments sharing, and real-time communication between participants. Sellers can manage their auctions by editing or deleting them, while bidders can revisit and review auctions they participated in. The administrative module empowers system administrators with tools to monitor and manage users, auctions, and bids, ensuring smooth and secure operations.

Ultimately, DMCF Chatbot aims to create a robust digital marketplace tailored to the unique needs of the agricultural sector. By leveraging technology to connect farmers and consumers directly, the platform promotes transparency, reduces intermediaries, and empowers the farming community to achieve better returns for their produce.

System Study

Existing Systems

Traditional rural markets primarily depend on middlemen to facilitate trade between farmers and buyers. While these intermediaries simplify the selling process, they significantly reduce the income earned by farmers as they claim a substantial share of the profits. Additionally, existing online platforms for agricultural trading are often limited in functionality, lacking features such as real-time communication and automated updates. This creates inefficiencies in transaction processing and leads to slower decision-making. Furthermore, outdated interfaces and insufficient communication tools make it challenging for users, particularly farmers, to navigate these platforms effectively, ultimately discouraging widespread adoption.

The absence of timely updates in these systems adds to the inefficiencies. Users are often unaware of critical changes in the market or auction status, causing delays in decision-making and missed opportunities. This results in reduced profitability for farmers and diminishes the overall utility of these platforms. To fully realize the potential of online agricultural trading, it is essential to address these limitations by incorporating features like real-time communication, automated notifications, and user-friendly design to ensure a more efficient and productive system.

Proposed System

The proposed system leverages technology to create a robust platform for direct marketing of food crops, eliminating the need for middlemen. By integrating a web portal with a chatbot, it facilitates seamless communication and bidding for both buyers and sellers. Registered users can initiate new bids, place offers, and communicate effectively within the platform. Automated email notifications provide real-time updates on bidding statuses, market developments, and auction closures, ensuring users remain informed at all times. This system streamlines the trading process and enhances user engagement, addressing many of the challenges faced by existing systems.

A key innovation is the chatbot, which enables instant interaction and assists users in navigating the platform efficiently. By reducing communication barriers, the chatbot fosters direct interactions between buyers and sellers, increasing transparency and trust. This approach not only enhances the overall trading experience but also ensures that participants have access to timely and accurate information, helping them make informed decisions. The system focuses on optimizing the bidding process, from initiation to closure, to support farmers and buyers in achieving their goals effectively.
